# 🚛 Air Pressure System Failure Analysis – Scania Trucks

This project analyzes operational data from Scania heavy trucks to predict failures in the Air Pressure System (APS).  
It was developed as part of the **Higher Diploma in Data Analytics (HDip) coursework**.

The goal is to use dimensionality reduction and machine learning techniques to identify early signs of component failure, helping companies optimize maintenance strategies.
